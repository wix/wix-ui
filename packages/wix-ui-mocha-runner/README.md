# wix-ui-mocha-runner

Run unit tests in headless Chromium using Mocha and Puppeteer.

The package provides `wix-ui-mocha-runner` CLI program which needs to run in the project root. The test results are logged to the terminal. All browser console output is redirected to the terminal as well.

To run tests interactively in watch mode with hot reload start `wix-ui-mocha-runner --watch`, and open [http//127.0.0.1:7357](http//127.0.0.1:7357). You can click the play icon to the right of the test name or a group of tests to run only a subset of tests. If the test page starts to constantly refresh make sure it's not open in mutliple tabs.

The tools performs the following setup for you:
* Configures Mocha with "BDD"-style interface
* Configures Enzyme with `enzyme-adapter-react-16` adapter
* Exposes [expect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expect) assertion library as a global variable
* Adds a level of compatibility with tests written for Jest:
  * Exposes [jest-mock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-mock) as a global named `jest`, which allows to use `jest.fn()`
  * Adds an alias `beforeAll()` for `before()`
  * Adds an alias `afterAll()` for `after()`
* Adds a test reporter for TeamCity
